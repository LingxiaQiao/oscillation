# MATLAB code for the oscillation paper (Qiao et al., eLife, 2022)
Run run_in.m or run_ex.m to obtain dynamics and autocorrelation functions for representative networks from five different categories. 
The file run_in.m is in the presence of intrinsic noise, and run_ex.m is in the presence of extrinsic noise
