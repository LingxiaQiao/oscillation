# MATLAB code for the oscillation paper (Qiao et al., eLife, 2022)
## How to use?
Run run_in.m or run_ex.m to obtain dynamics and autocorrelation functions for representative networks from five different categories. 
The file run_in.m is in the presence of intrinsic noise, and run_ex.m is in the presence of extrinsic noise.

The zip file includes the single cell data for NFkB and the script for plotting.

Check out our paper ([Qiao et al., eLife, 2022](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76188)) for the detailed methods.
